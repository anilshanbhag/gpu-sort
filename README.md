GPU Sort
======

Contains state-of-the-art implementations of 3 sorting algorithms for GPUs:

* MSB Radix Sort 
* LSB Radix Sort
* Bitonic Sort (coming soon)

Check the respective folders for instructions on how to run the sort implementation.

Performance
-----

For sorting 32-bit keys, MSB radix sort is the fastest. LSB radix sort is the easy to use and does stable sorting.
